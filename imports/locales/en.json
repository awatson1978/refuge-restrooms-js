      "second": "When the Safe2Pee website passed out of functionality in 2012, it left a hole in our ability to find a bathroom in which we weren't going to be harassed or worse. REFUGE picks up where SAFE2PEE left off, allowing individuals to find and add safe restroom locations."
    },
    "p2header": "Where's the data from?",
    "p2": "The first 4500 entries are from the old Safe2Pee database. The rest are community-sourced. If you don't see a restroom in your area, add it! The more restrooms the better.",
    "p3header": "What's the point?",
    "p3": "We believe that everyone should have access to a safe restroom, free from gender restrictions or harassment. The transgender, intersex, and gender nonconforming communities are especially affected by this lack of access, and we'd like to change that.",
    "p4header": "What are the levels of privacy built into this application?",
    "p4": "Our key concern is safety. REFUGE is a crowdsourced platform, which means we rely on users like you to keep it accurate and up-to-date. We emphasize community oversight rather than government/authority regulation to prevent harm. Please report any safety concerns using the Contact form."
